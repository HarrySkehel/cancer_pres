Cancer effects people of all ages and genders. Some people have a genetic predisposition to certain cancers, breast cancer for example has very clear genetic indicators.

Some cancers are also gender specific, only men can get prostate cancer and only women can get ovarian cancer for example.

I have investigated the cancer rates in the Scottish Borders and had a further look into the age of cancer patients who have died. 

Secondly I have investigated the most occuring cancer types for each gender to find out if there are any cancers that are prevalent in both genders.

Finally I also aimed to identify if the most reported cancer types were also the cancer types that were the highest causes of death
 
 10 highest incidences by gender
 

```{r echo=FALSE}
top_10_male_incidences %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = cancer_site, y = number_of_registrations) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

top_10_male_incidences %>% 
  head(5)

top_10_Female_incidences %>% 
  head(5) 

top_10_Female_incidences %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = cancer_site, y = number_of_registrations) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
top_10_male_deaths %>% 
  head(5)

top_10_female_deaths %>% 
  head(5)


```
death ages seperated by gender
```{r}
borders_deaths_long %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = age, y = number_of_deaths) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(~ sex)
